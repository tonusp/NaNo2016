# NaNo2016
Thank you everyone who encouraged me and cheered me on while I was writing *A Book of Changes*. You can read it online here by clicking on the [Markdown file](https://github.com/tonusp/NaNo2016/blob/master/A_Book_of_Changes.md) above. Or if you prefer you can download the [PDF file](https://github.com/tonusp/NaNo2016/blob/master/A_Book_of_Changes.pdf) and read it on your own computer. If I can work out how, I may even try putting it up in .epub format.

Any comments are suggestions always welcome! GitHub is all about sharing works-in-progress.

I also have a 'new' occasional blog hosted here on GitHub, called [Godspelled](http://tonusp.github.io/). Drop by any time.
